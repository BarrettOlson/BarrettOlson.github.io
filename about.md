## Barrett Olson 

I am currently a Master's Student in Computer Science and Graduate Student Research Assistant.  I graduated with a Bachelor of Science from the U of M in May 2017, majoring in Computer Science and Organizational Studies ([OS](https://lsa.umich.edu/orgstudies)). 

I am currently conducting research around the application of HCI and speech recognition   on accessible programming for [Prof. Narayanasamy](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~nsatish/). My broader research interests are how computer science and technology can improve education and accessibility 

I spend my time at Michigan simultaneously learning, developing as a teacher, conducting research, and helping the next generation of students at the University of Michigan.
