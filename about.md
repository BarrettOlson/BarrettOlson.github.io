I am currently a Master's Student in Computer Science and Graduate Student Instruction for Engineering 101 at the University of Michigan. 
 
I graduated with a Bachelor of Science for the University of Michigan in Spring 2017, double majoring in Computer Science and Organizational Studies (OS). My two discrete academic focuses have prepared me to think critically and engage in numerous areas.
