## Barrett Olson
I am currently a Master's Student in Computer Science and Graduate Student Instruction for Engineering 101 at the University of Michigan. I graduated with a Bachelor of Science from the U of M in May 2017, majoring in Computer Science and Organizational Studies ([OS](https://lsa.umich.edu/orgstudies)). 

I am currently conducting research around the application of machine learning on accessible programming for [Prof. Narayanasamy](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~nsatish/). Specifically developing programming environment that utilizes automatic speech recognition. My research interests more broadly are how computer science and technology can improve education and accessibility 

I spend my time at Michigan simultaneously learning, developing as a teacher, conducting research, and helping the next generation of students at the University of Michigan.
