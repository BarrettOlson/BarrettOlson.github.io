## Contact Info 
I love meeting new people and getting to know people I've already met. I alway happy to talk about my research or work. Please don't hesitate to reach out. My preferred method of commutation is usually email but feel free to shoot me a text, especially if we've already met. (ENGR 101 students should use the office course email for all class related commutation)
