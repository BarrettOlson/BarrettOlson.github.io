      <H3>Example of work:</H3>
      <p> In the Fall 2016 term, I facilitated a discussion/dialogue about the several terrorist attacks abroad and the perception the media was giving it. More specifically the perception of the world’s muslim population and the issue related to only focusing on the Paris attack were several attacks had occurred in non-western countries around a similar time. I did this for one of my student orgs because it directly affects some of the identities within the org. while many others were unaware of these issues. </p>

<H3>Skills, Strengths and Challenges: </H3>
<p>We had a good dialogue and discussion but it was especially challenging due to the  subject matter and the identities dynamics at play. Especially because I did not share the target identities. From this activity I learned the importance of letting go of the conversation and also the subtleties monitoring individual’s airtime. I also learned the importance of mutual respect in these activities. </p>

<p>In addition I learn that while you cannot prepare for everything there are several key strategies that can be used to fit most situations. </p>

<ul>
  <li>A key starting point is simply to listen see where the group is on a topic and meet everyone where they are. </li>
  <li>If people are not sharing as much as would be preferred a good method is to briefly state a personal perspective so that others can build on yours. 
</li>
  <li>Once you have some involvement feel free to investigate comments further to fully flesh out the discussion and increased clarity for everyone involved.
</li>
</ul>

 


<p>I will use what I have learned to be a effective resident advisor and work to actively listen both as a leader on my hall and as a follower to my LT.
